In our analysis, we are using Tableau to create visualization that may lead us to new insights about the performances of the baseball players in our data. \n"

    "Initially, histograms were created for analyzing the batting average versus height/weight and BMI versus batting average. However, these variables are quantitaive, and after getting a feedback suggestion from my mentor Dominic, I decided on creating scatterplots for these quantitative variables. It was found that height/weight ratio of 0.4 had the best average batting score of 0.296 and players with BMI of approximately 23 had the best batting average score of approximately 0.3. \n"

    "I wanted to also see if area graphs can be used to study the relationships between some of the variables. I first attempted to create an area graph using height versus total home runs. However, because I was summing the total home runs per each different height integer, I concluded that this graph did not represent the data very well. For example, it appeared that there was a great variance between the people with height (in inches) 69 and 72. But this is because the total home runs were summed. Therefore, I modified this visual representation by using the average of total home runs per each height value. I also had to filter out the 0 home runs within the original dataset because when the 0s were included, the graph became very jagged and noisy. This data cleaning resulted in an improvement on the smoothing of the area curve. According to this modified graph comparing height versus the average home runs, people with the height of 67 inches had the best average of total home runs. \n",
