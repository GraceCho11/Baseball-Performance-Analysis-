# Baseball-Performance-Analysis-
This project is analyzing the different variables that may affect the baseball players' performances.

In this project we will study and create an explanatory data visualization of a data-set containing 1,157 baseball players including their handedness (right, left handed, or both), height (in inches), weight (in pounds), home runs, and batting average. In our analysis, we are using Tableau to create visualization that may lead us to new insights about the performances of the baseball players in our data.
